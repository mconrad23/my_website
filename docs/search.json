    "text": "I was born and raised in San Diego and have lived all of my life within the most southern county in California. Growing up in San Diego has been one of the biggest blessings in my life and I feel so grateful to have lived close to family and friends. My parents were also born and raised in San Diego and met at San Diego State University in the late 90s and decided to raise my sister and I here next to grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.\nOne of my favorite parts of living here is being so close to the beach. My childhood and adolescence were spent swimming in the sea, catching waves, exploring tide pools, and soaking up the sun. The beach is my favorite place to be and I go as often as I can.\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Diego coastline\n\n\nView of San Diego coastline from La Jolla Scenic Beach Trail\n\n\n\n\nFamily pictures\n\n\nMy mom, dad, sister and me at Windansea Beach c.¬†2012"

    "text": "Environmental Education\nMy dad has been a middle school science teacher my whole life and has rooted in me a passion for education and learning. In my third and fourth year of college, I have taken several courses in environmental and science education; these courses have taught me the foundations and defining principles of environmental education, and have taught me essential skills such as writing lesson plans that align with state curriculum standards. I have also had the chance to volunteer on the after-school programs with the Wilderness Youth Project (WYP) where I have had the chance to see first hand how building nature connection and having unstructured time to explore is so beneficial for kids‚Äô development into environmentally-conscious adults. I hope to one day work in the field of environmental education and teach others about the importance of caring for the natural world around us\n\n Thursday Dragonflies - one of the after-school groups I was a volunteer for with WYP. This group was made up on kids in grades 3-5 and they were always eager to explore new places"

    "text": "Restoration\nI am also passionate about habitat restoration and the re-wilding natural places. I have taken courses like ‚ÄúConservation Planning‚Äù, ‚ÄúRestoration Skills‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBiodiversity & Conservation Biology‚Äù which have taught me about what it means to conserve habitats for both the species that live there and the people who derive ecosystem services from natural spaces.\nI have also worked as a Student Restoration Worker at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration (CCBER) where I have been able to participate in restoration work and learn about the process of designing and implementing a restoration project. I have learned a whole host of new skills, including how to install irrigation lines, identify invasive plant species, and different planting methods for native species in dfferent habitats. The projects I have mostly been involved with are the restoration of the Ellwood Mesa Butterfly Grove and the continued management of the restored North Campus Open Space.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllwood Mesa Butterfly Grove\n\n\nEucalyptus trees in Ellwood Mesa Butterfly Grove\n\n\n\n\nNorth Campus Open Space\n\n\nView of NCOS from back of Gator"

I love learning about the connections between beach habitats, coastal wetlands, and deep-sea ecosystems. The fact that we know more about the surface of the Moon than we do about the oceans on our planet astounds me. Some of my favorite courses I‚Äôve taken while at UCSB had to do with the ocean including ‚ÄúSea Turtle Conservation & Species Management‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarine Resources‚Äù and in the future I hope to pursue a higher edcuation degree that is more specifically focused on coastal and marine ecosystems.\n\n My favorite animals are sea turtles and seeing them on a beach in Hawai‚Äôi for the first time is something I will never forget!"
