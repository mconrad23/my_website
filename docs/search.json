    "text": "I was born and raised in San Diego and have lived all of my life within the most southern county in California. Growing up in San Diego has been one of the biggest blessings in my life and I feel so grateful to have lived close to family and friends. My parents were also born and raised in San Diego and met at San Diego State University in the late 90s and decided to raise my sister and I here next to grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.\nOne of my favorite parts of living here is being so close to the beach. My childhood and adolescence were spent swimming in the sea, catching waves, exploring tide pools, and soaking up the sun. The beach is my favorite place to be and I go as often as I can.\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Diego coastline\n\n\nView of San Diego coastline from La Jolla Scenic Beach Trail\n\n\n\n\nFamily pictures\n\n\nMy mom, dad, sister and me at Windansea Beach c. 2012"
