# Sunsets

Here is a collection of some of my favorite sunsets that I've seen! 



# Spotify Playlists

For the past four years, every month I make a new playlist of songs that I are new to me, one that I am listening to on repeat, and ones I am rediscovering. At the end of the month I transfer the monthly playlist into a yearly one which I review at the end of the year. I love going back and seeing how my music taste has evolved, what new artists I am listening to, and which ones I keep on repeat. Take a look at my yearly playlists below!
